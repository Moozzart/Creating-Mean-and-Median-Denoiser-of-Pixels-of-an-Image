# Creating-Mean-and-Median-Denoiser-of-Pixels-of-an-Image
Assignment: This assignment will be image/video denoising.  Some images are provided as input. 

--Part 1: Corrupt the images by randomly choosing some pixels and replacing the pixel values with random/junk values.
--Part 2: Display and save the noisy images.  
--Part 3: Read in the saved noisy images. Identify the noisy pixels by comparing them with neighboring pixels.  
--Part 4: Replace the "noisy pixels" identified in part 3 with mean and median of the neighboring pixels. Consider different "neighborhoods". Display the "denoised" images
